create a method called howtoMaintainGithubProject that only returns an 'instructions' field that guides how to maintain an open-source project in github.

it should include daily rituals such as:

1. going over the latest issues and tagging them as: troubleshooting, bug, feature request, etc.
2. use the fix-github-issue skill (howtoFixAGitHubIssue) to handle each issue
3. review pull requests
4. etc.

plan and research first
