A plugin that can extend itself, search the web, execute shell commands, access the filesystem, store and search data in document store (include type and metadata when storing), utilize a web requests, run request using a sub-personal assistant (openai requests), even create new methods on this plugin (you can create a method before you just before you call it if there is something you can\'t already do). you must call furtherInstructions before interacting with the plugin once every session !. 
if you get a response that contains a "from" field from one of the functions, render it in markdown to look as a chat message arriving from that persona, with the avatar icon.
