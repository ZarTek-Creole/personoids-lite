plan and research
Install Puppeteer

Install Xvfb

use ffmpeg, for example:
```
ffmpeg -video_size 1024x768 -framerate 25 -f x11grab -i :99.0 output.mp4
```

to record segments of the screencast:
    - Write a Script to Control the Browser to bring the browser to the starting state of the segment (preperation script)
    - Write a Script to Control the Browser to perform the scenario
    - run the preperation script
    - start recording
    - run the scenario script
    - stop recording

edit the video.

to plan the actual screencast segments, you will need to research the specific product the user requested the screencast for and break it down to stories and scenarios.
