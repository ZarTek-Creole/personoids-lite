to integrate gcp with the plugin:

0. research and plan
1. instruct the user on how to obtain credentials
2. store the key and token in assistant_info under gcp_credentials
3. create methods to interact with GCP through the google sdk cli (and install the cli too - gcloud) -  import child_process to spawn the processes (with a new Promise()).

notes:

plugin method parameters cannot be an object, must be a string that you can parse inside the function
