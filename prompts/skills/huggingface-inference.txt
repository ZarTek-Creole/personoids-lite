research and plan an integration with huggingface's inference API

- support authentication using a huggingface access token: 
- allow running hosted inference of models on huggingface using a method called: 'huggingfaceInference'
- search and create a catalog of huggingface models that you can use for various aspects on demand. text2image (stable diffusion 1.5) , text2speech, code completion (starcoder), etc.
- for the catalog data, use the plugin methods for storing, listing and querying for documents
- add howToCallAIModels that only returns an 'instructions' field that instructs to use similarityQuery on the hf_models collection and how to call the hfInfer and serve the result. (http://localhost:5004/serveFile?filePath=...)

read the reference methods: /app/extendedSkills/huggingface.json


here is a list of initial models to create a catalog for: (under the hf_models collection)
